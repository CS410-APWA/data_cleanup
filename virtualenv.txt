Hi! This is a guideline for setting up virtual environments for this project.

If you are using Python2, you'll want to install the virtualenv tool with pip:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Otherwise, you should already have the venv module from the standard library.

I also recommend using virtualenvwrapper - it conveniently stores your virtual 
environments in one location. Install with:
```
# Mac or Linux
pip install virtualenvwrapper
# Windows
pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
```

Then, put the following in either your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile:
```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs   # Optional, overrides built-in
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/projects      # Optional, you should customize this
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
Reload your shell for your changes to take effect.

The following will be how to use virtualenvwrapper.

Making a new virtual environment:
```
mkvirtualenv my-new-environment
```

Activating your new virtual environment:
```
workon my-new-environment
```

Deactivate your new virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```

If for some reason you want to get rid of your environment:
```
rmvirtualenv my-new-environment
```

Best of luck!
